# Interactive plots with Matplotlib

Tutorials on how to interact with your mouse on plots, definining quite everything you want regarding your action.

## Files
For the notebooks, there is a md version for visualisation of the code, and a ipynb for using it.

## Launching

I recommand to launch the notebooks in a browser (Firefox). For example, Interactive does not work in VS Code.

## Requirements :
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- jupyterlab
