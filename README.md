# Interactive plots with Matplotlib

Tutorials on how to interact with your mouse on plots, definining quite everything you want regarding your action.

I recommand to clone (do `git clone https://github.com/Hbretonniere/interactive_plots.git` in a terminal) the project to be able to easily run the notebooks.
If not, you can always download 'by hand' the notebooks and read the paragraph below to run them.

## Files

For the notebooks, there is a `.md` version for visualisation of the code without the figures, and a `.ipynb` for using it. It's ok that the .ipynb files does not opened in github web, you should just use it after cloning the repo.

To launch a notebook, you must have Jupyter installed in your machine, and run the command `jupyter notebook` in a terminal. It will open a webpage representing the folder from which you launched the command. Then, you just need to navigate to the folder containing the `.ipynb` you want to run, and click it.

I recommand to launch the notebooks in a browser (Firefox). For example, Interactive plots do not work in VS Code.
